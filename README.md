# Loan Price Prediction

In this project, I analyzed data on loans issued through the [LendingClub](https://www.lendingclub.com/) platform.  On the LendingClub platform, potential lenders see some information about potential borrowers, along with an interest rate they'll be paid.  The potential lenders then decide if the interest on the loan is worth the risk of a default (the loan not being repaid), and decide whether to lend to the borrower.  LendingClub publishes anonymous data about its loans and their repayment rates.

Using the data, I analyzed factors that correlated with loans being repaid on time, and did some exploratory visualization and analysis.  I then created a model that predicts the chance that a loan will be repaid given the data surfaced on the LendingClub site.  This model could be useful for potential lenders trying to decide if they should fund a loan.  You can see the exploratory data analysis in the `Exploration.ipynb` notebook above.  You can see the model code and explanations in the `algo` folder.
